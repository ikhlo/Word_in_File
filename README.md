# A Text File Search Application

Here is my first C project made one year ago. The purpose of this one is to search in a data structure a word (which acts as a dictionnary). We can find a word with the first or last characters of this one.
There was two steps for this project. The first one was the conception of an efficient data structure. I chose a Binary Search Tree structure to represent the dictionnary. The advantages of this structure are explained in the pdf document in the directory. 
Then the second step was the function which will compare the entered word with the words in the BST.

As I said, this code has been made more than one year ago and was my first project in C. This mean it is not optimized and today, I see several improvements and corrections that can be made on it. However it can be considered as a first draft of a next project.
